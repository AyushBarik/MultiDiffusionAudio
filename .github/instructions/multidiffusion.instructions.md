# MultiDiffusion Algorithm for Long-Form Audio Generation

## Core Concept
MultiDiffusion generates long audio sequences by processing overlapping chunks and averaging their overlapping regions at **every denoising timestep** to maintain global coherence.

## Key Components

### 1. Chunk Creation with Overlaps
- Split target audio into overlapping chunks (e.g., 50-frame overlaps)
- Each chunk processes a portion of the mel spectrogram
- Overlaps ensure smooth transitions between chunks

### 2. Parallel Diffusion Processing
- Initialize a full-length noise tensor matching target audio duration
- At each denoising timestep, extract chunk-sized portions from global tensor
- Apply diffusion model to each chunk independently

### 3. Overlap Averaging (The Key Innovation)
- After each denoising step, fuse all chunk predictions
- Average overlapping regions using weighted summation
- **This happens at EVERY timestep, not just at the end**

## Implementation Algorithm

```python
def multidiffusion_chunked_predict(mel_spectrogram, model, target_chunks, overlap_frames):
    # 1. Create overlapping chunks
    chunks = create_simple_overlapping_chunks(total_frames, target_chunks, overlap_frames)
    
    # 2. Initialize full-length noise tensor
    audio = torch.randn(1, full_audio_length, device=device)
    
    # 3. For each denoising timestep (n from T-1 to 0):
    for n in range(len(alpha) - 1, -1, -1):
        # 3a. Extract chunks from current full audio
        chunk_audios = []
        for start_frame, end_frame in chunks:
            start_sample = start_frame * hop_samples
            end_sample = end_frame * hop_samples
            chunk_audios.append(audio[:, start_sample:end_sample])
        
        # 3b. Apply diffusion model to each chunk
        denoised_chunks = []
        for audio_chunk, mel_chunk in zip(chunk_audios, chunk_mels):
            # Standard diffusion denoising step
            model_output = model(audio_chunk, timestep, mel_chunk)
            denoised_chunk = c1 * (audio_chunk - c2 * model_output)
            # Add noise if not final step
            if n > 0:
                denoised_chunk += sigma * torch.randn_like(audio_chunk)
            denoised_chunks.append(denoised_chunk)
        
        # 3c. FUSE: Average overlapping regions (MultiDiffusion Equation 5)
        weight_sum = torch.zeros_like(audio)
        weighted_audio = torch.zeros_like(audio)
        
        for i, (start_frame, end_frame) in enumerate(chunks):
            start_sample = start_frame * hop_samples
            end_sample = end_frame * hop_samples
            weighted_audio[:, start_sample:end_sample] += denoised_chunks[i]
            weight_sum[:, start_sample:end_sample] += 1.0
        
        # Average overlapping regions
        audio = weighted_audio / weight_sum
```

## Critical Implementation Details

### Overlap Strategy
- Use 50-frame overlaps for audio (about 0.6 seconds at 22kHz)
- Balance between coherence and computational efficiency

### Memory Management
- Process chunks in parallel but manage GPU memory carefully
- Consider sequential processing if memory is limited

### Boundary Handling
- Ensure chunks cover the entire audio length without gaps
- Handle edge cases at audio boundaries

### Averaging Formula
- Simple weighted average where overlap regions get contributions from multiple chunks
- Weight sum ensures proper normalization across overlaps

## Integration with AudioLDM

When implementing in AudioLDM:
1. Modify the main diffusion sampling loop in `pipeline.py`
2. Add chunk creation and overlap handling utilities
3. Replace single forward pass with chunked processing
4. Implement overlap averaging at each timestep
5. Ensure compatibility with existing conditioning (text embeddings)
